No other external dependencies required.

## Compiling & Running the Application
Navigate to SchedulerSubsystem.java -> Run the main method
</br>
Navigate to ElevatorSubsystem.java -> Run the main method
</br>
Navigate to Floor.java -> Run the main method

The output should be in the console of eclipse

# Iteration 1
Set up an application for 3 subsystems: Floor, Scheduler, and Elevator. 
Floor thread send the request to the Scheduler and the Scheduler assign the request to the Elevator. 
The Elevator will notify the Scheduler to notify the Floor that the request has been finished. 
The ElevatorRequest as a shared object that is used for threads to communicate.

# Iteration 2
Adding State Machine functionality for the Scheduler subsystem and Elevator subsystem. Demonstrating the state changes of subsystems when there is an action or event that trigger it

# Iteration 3
Split up system to separate programs that can be run on three separate computers and communicate with each other using UDP.
The Scheduler will now be used to coordinate the movement of cars such that each car carries roughly the same number of passengers as all of the others and so that the waiting time for passengers at floors is minimized.
The state machines for each car should execute independently of each other, but they will all have to share their position with the scheduler. The scheduler will choose which elevator will be used to service a given request.

# Iteration 4
Adding error states for DOOR_STUCK and ELEVATOR_STUCK by determining the floor would case these state to happen. If the elevator reaches those floor the error state would appear. 
Adding the state machine pattern, making the system configurable

## Project structure:

The project is separated into `main` and `test` packages, where each package has a specific functionality <br/>
