## Work Distribution

The work distribution is divided into tasks and displayed in this JIRA link:
[JIRA - Agile Board](https://sysc3303-project-group-7.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/ECSS/boards/1)

The work breakdown responsibility of the project for the iteration is located:

* documentation/P3G7-Responsibilities.pdf

## Documentation

The UML class diagram and the UML sequence diagram of the system is contained in
the documentation folder labeled: 

* documentation/P5-UML-class.drawio.pdf
* documentation/P4-UML-sequence.drawio.pdf

## Requirements & Dependencies

* Java JDK-17 or later version
* JUnit 4 for unit testing

No other external dependencies required.

## Compiling & Running the Application
Navigate to GUI.java -> Run the main method
</br>
Navigate to SchedulerSubsystem.java -> Run the main method
</br>
Navigate to ElevatorSubsystem.java -> Run the main method
</br>
Navigate to FloorSubsystem.java -> Run the main method

The output should be in the console of eclipse and in the GUI

# Iteration 1
Set up an application for 3 subsystems: Floor, Scheduler, and Elevator. 
Floor thread send the request to the Scheduler and the Scheduler assign the request to the Elevator. 
The Elevator will notify the Scheduler to notify the Floor that the request has been finished. 
The ElevatorRequest as a shared object that is used for threads to communicate.

# Iteration 2
Adding State Machine functionality for the Scheduler subsystem and Elevator subsystem. Demonstrating the state changes of subsystems when there is an action or event that trigger it

# Iteration 3
Split up system to separate programs that can be run on three separate computers and communicate with each other using UDP.
The Scheduler will now be used to coordinate the movement of cars such that each car carries roughly the same number of passengers as all of the others and so that the waiting time for passengers at floors is minimized.
The state machines for each car should execute independently of each other, but they will all have to share their position with the scheduler. The scheduler will choose which elevator will be used to service a given request.

# Iteration 4
Adding error states for DOOR_STUCK and ELEVATOR_STUCK by determining the floor would case these state to happen. If the elevator reaches those floor the error state would appear. 
Adding the state machine pattern, making the system configurable

# Iteration 5
Adding GUI for the program to demonstrate to represent the workflow </br>
Adding the elevator and components logics such as the arrival sensor, buttons, and lamps
Improving assigning requests algorithm to the Scheduler </br>
Adjust the error handling by adding a new column to the input.txt file </br>
Adding unit tests and fix bugs

## Project structure:

The project is separated into `main` and `test` packages, where each package has a specific functionality <br/>
